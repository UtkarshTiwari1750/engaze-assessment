ðŸ’¿ Hey developer ðŸ‘‹

You can provide a way better UX than this when your app throws errors by providing your own ErrorBoundary or errorElement prop on your route.

6) No button to save the changes made inside the resume or automatice debounce save of the update 
7) "Section type "contact" not implemented yet" Getting this text for the section which is not handled in the code provide a default editing place for such sections
8) PDF download button gives this error "Unexpected Application Error!
404 Not Found

9) Allow addition of new sections and section type from UI.
10) Changes in the design doesn't gets reflected in real-time, it required external reload.



Fix Following issues
1) <ContentEditable
            value=""
            onChange={() => {}}
            placeholder="Email â€¢ Phone â€¢ Location â€¢ LinkedIn"
            className="text-center"
          />

Placeholder is not getting remove on addition of text

2) Skills addition not working, is adding the section but not able to add data or edit the placeholders for the section
	Example: Contact info working perfectly able to change title and content but in skill and experience the not able to make those changes in UI.
3) On deactivating Section Eye button
Unexpected Application Error!

4) In the share page resume content is displayed in rendered in JSON format, it should render in the pdf format like same as editor page
5) The downloaded pdf is getting "unable to open document, File type HTML document (text/html) is not supported" fix it.
6) "Not Saved" test on top left is not static it should change after successful save/update
