I have the following verification comments after thorough review and exploration of the codebase. Implement the comments by following the instructions in the comments verbatim.

## Comment 1: Editor core features are missing; many planned components are empty stubs.

Implement the editor components in `client/src/components/editor/*` and `client/src/components/sections/*` and `client/src/components/templates/*` per the plan. Wire them into `EditorPage.tsx` with state from Redux and server mutations via TanStack Query or thunks. Ensure on-canvas editing, DnD, and design panel interactions are functional.
